# JAMSTACK

## What JAMSTACK is

JAMSTACK stands for :

***Javascript***\
***Apis***\
**Markup**

> Basiclly, it means that you use ***Javascript*** on client side and using that to call ***Apis*** which updates your **Markup**.\
> It's an approach to web design that emphasizes shipping only static assets and that helps eliminating a lot of complexity


## Benefits of Jamstack
- Reduced complexity (only shipping assets so no cache, nginx, kubernetes, database )
- Lower cost (Deploying jamstack app is cheap, even free)
- Faster shipping ( having only html, css and javascript makes " it works on my machine " very reliable )
- Increased autonomy ( No need to be back-end developer or devops to deploy Jamstack app )
- Better security ( only static files are shipped )
- Better performance ( only static files fetch from a cdn so really fast shipping )
- Better reliability ( no server that can fail, no cache misconfigured, no database )
